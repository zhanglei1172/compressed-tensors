    Scheme used to parameterize a particular transform type and specify how and where it
    should be applied to the model

        and applied. This should be one of the registered transform types
        (see `Transforms.registered_names()`)

        modules that should be targeted by the specified transform
    :param randomize: True if uniquely randomized transform weights should be used,
        otherwise use identical transform weights where applicable
    :param requires_grad: True if weights include gradients for training
    :param head_dim: If set, the transform matrix will be block diagonal with each
        block being a square matrix of this size. The name head_dim was chosen because
        some rotations need to be block-diagonal with block size equal to the head_dim,
        but research has shown value in applying some rotations with smaller block size,
        irrespective of head_dim.
    :param precision: Precision at which this transform should be applied during online
        rotations. Fused (offline) rotations are always performed in float64
